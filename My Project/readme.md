ROCK PAPER SCISSOR PROJECT

This is a test project intended to practice JavaScript by creating a "Rock, Paper, Scissor" game that can be played in console. 

Built With: 
    -HTML5
    -JavaScript

Usage:
    The user will be able to play against the computer. The computer will randomly select Rock, Paper, or Scissor and the browser will prompt the user to enter their selection of Rock, Paper, or Scissor. The user will play five rounds before the winner is determined.

What I learned:
    -How to really write a readme file
    -How to have a random selection
    -How to determine the value of strings

What I struggled with most:
    -getting the user input to go all lowercase while in 'while loop'
    -getting the computer to generate random answer while in 'while loop'

What am I least confident about: 
    -Pseudocode. Am I actually understanding how to break the problem down?
    -what the heck a '/n' even does
